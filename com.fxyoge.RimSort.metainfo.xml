      Unofficial flatpak for [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Common permission overrides</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If using the normal version of Steam: <code>flatpak override --user com.fxyoge.RimSort --filesystem &quot;~/.config/unity3d/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld by Ludeon Studios/Config&quot; --filesystem &quot;~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld&quot; --filesystem &quot;~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/294100&quot;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...or, if using flatpak Steam: <code>flatpak override --user com.fxyoge.RimSort --filesystem &quot;~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/config/unity3d/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld by Ludeon Studios/Config&quot; --filesystem &quot;~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld&quot; --filesystem &quot;~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/294100&quot;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...and any additional libraries you have: <code>flatpak override --user com.fxyoge.RimSort --filesystem &quot;/path/to/your/steam/library/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/RimWorld&quot; --filesystem &quot;/path/to/your/steam/library/SteamLibrary/steamapps/workshop/content/294100&quot;</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You could instead give access to e.g. all of <code>~/.steam/steam/steamapps</code>, if you&apos;re so inclined. I prefer to only give it what it needs and recommend doing the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Known issues</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The &quot;Browse Workshop&quot; window might not work as expected because RimSort doesn&apos;t have access to Steam, and therefore is &quot;Unable to initialize Steamworks API due to exception: SteamNotRunningException&quot;. Probably just need to set up the right permissions, but I don&apos;t use that feature so I haven&apos;t tried fixing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running the game from RimSort breaks for the same reason - it doesn&apos;t have access to Steam. 
      </li>
      <li>
        RimSort will crash on some machines (e.g. mine, lol) when clicking any button that opens a file browser dialog such as the four game, config, etc. folder selectors, or the git repo configs. This issue appears to happen in the normal version of the app, so I think it&apos;s just a plain ol&apos; boring bug. Workaround: directly modify the config at <code>~/.var/app/com.fxyoge.RimSort/data/RimSort/settings.json</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
